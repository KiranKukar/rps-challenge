Rock Paper Scissors Game

 - I started by setting up the test environment, rackup and sinatra; so that I can use test driven development.

 - I added a form for player to input their name and a 'play' view for it to be presented on (for now I'm using a global variable, I will refactor it out later as it is not good practice)

 - I added buttons so the player can pick out of Rock, Paper and Scissors to play. They are redirected to the results page that shows their choice.

 - I set up the game class to receive the players name and choice from app.rb

 - I wrote the tests to give the result of who wins, and have begun the code but not been able to complete it yet.
