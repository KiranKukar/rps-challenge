Rock Paper Scissors Game

 - I started by setting up the test environment, rackup and sinatra; so that I can use test driven development.

 - I added a form for player to input their name and a 'play' view for it to be presented on (for now I'm using a global variable, I will refactor it out later as it is not good practice)
